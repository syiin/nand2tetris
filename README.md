# nand2tetris

My progress through the nand2tetris course - a lot of fun! Would recommend anybody who needs a refresher on lower level concepts. Progress so far:

Project: 
- [x] 1 Built basic logic gates using primitive NAND gate using HDL hardware simulator langage  
- [x] 2 Used these basic logic gates to construct ALU, Half Adder, Full Adder, Incrementer...etc
- [x] 3 Using FlipFlops gates and other basic logic gates, construct RAM chips and a Program Counter
- [x] 4 Write basic programs with Hack assembly language and CPU emulator (ie. make a screen fill upon keyboard press and multiply 2 numbers stored in memory) 
- [x] 5 Built and tested a CPU, then tied the CPU to Memory chips to create a computer then test on some Hack assembly language programs 
- [x] 6 Wrote an assembler in C++ that converts a .asm assembly language file to .hack binary
